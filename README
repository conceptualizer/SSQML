 SSQML: Standard Structured Query Markup Language
     This is an XML dialect that allows any valid SQL statement, clause, expression, predicate, or query to be expressed fully in XML based on an XML compliant schema. 
     The schema is based on Backus Normal Form (BNF) representations of ANSI-ISO/IEC SQL Standards:
     	1. Final Committee Draft of ISO/IEC 9075 :2003
     	2. Final Committee Draft of ISO/IEC 9075 :2006
     	3. Final Committee Draft of ISO/IEC 9075 :2008
     	4. Final Committee Draft of ISO/IEC 9075-14 :2013 XML-Related Specifications (SQL/XML)
     	But does not include support for:
     		a. Embedded SQL Ada programs
		b. Embedded SQL C programs
		c. Embedded SQL COBOL programs
		d. Embedded SQL Fortran programs
		e. Embedded SQL MUMPS programs
		f. Embedded SQL Pascal programs
		g. Embedded SQL PL/I programs
		These may be added in future. 
     	
     This scheam was generated by automation taking the SQL BNFs as input. It was then run through schema validators and manually modified further to result in a valid schema.
     
     The scheam was designed such that if an instance document has its tags removed and the order of the content preserved, a valid SQL statment or fragment will be left. 
     In a few cases, elements may be repeated with the name having a incremented counter integer appended. This was neccessary to preserve the intent of the underlying SQL. 
     Wherever this repetition was avoidable, it was avoided without using integer suffixes. 
     
     The "StaticString" elements represent SQL reserved and protected literal phrases. 
     
     The Group elements were generated where complexTypes contain choices that were themselves sequences. The naming convention for these groups is ParentComplexTypeName_ISO9075ChoiceGroup#
