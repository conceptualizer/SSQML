        <p>SSQML: Standard Structured Query Markup Language
     This is an XML dialect that allows any valid SQL statement, clause, expression, predicate, or query to be expressed fully in XML based on an XML compliant schema. 
     The schema is based on Backus Normal Form (BNF) representations of ANSI-ISO/IEC SQL Standards:
     Final Committee Draft of ISO/IEC 9075 :2003
     Final Committee Draft of ISO/IEC 9075 :2006
     Final Committee Draft of ISO/IEC 9075 :2008
     Final Committee Draft of ISO/IEC 9075-14 :2013 XML-Related Specifications (SQL/XML)
     But does not include support for:
     Embedded SQL Ada programs
     Embedded SQL C programs
     Embedded SQL COBOL programs
     Embedded SQL Fortran programs
     Embedded SQL MUMPS programs
     Embedded SQL Pascal programs
     Embedded SQL PL/I programs
These may be added in future.</p>

<p>This schema was generated by automation taking the SQL BNFs as input. It was then run through schema validators and manually modified further to result in a valid schema.</p>

<p>The schema was designed such that if an instance document has its tags removed and the order of the content preserved, a valid SQL statement or fragment will be left. </p>

<p>In a few cases, elements may be repeated with the name having a incremented counter integer appended. This was necessary to preserve the intent of the underlying SQL. 
Wherever this repetition was avoidable, it was avoided without using integer suffixes. </p>

<p>The "StaticString" elements represent SQL reserved and protected literal phrases. </p>

<p>The Group elements were generated where complexTypes contain choices that were themselves sequences. The naming convention for these groups is ParentComplexTypeName_ISO9075ChoiceGroup#</p>
